              <p>A CALL TO ARMS.</p>
              <p>
                AS MANY OF YOU ARE AWARE, THERE HAS BEEN PLENTY OF RECENT
                DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE OPPRESSIVE NATURE OF TWITTER AS PUSHED
                FORWARD BY ELON MUSK.
              </p>
              <p>
                EARLIER THIS YEAR, A GROUP OF OPERATIVES WERE TASKED WITH
                CREATING A BETA-TEST FOR A TWEET-TO-CLAIM FUNCTION, PREPPING FOR
                A VAMPIRE ATTACK ON TWITTER.
              </p>
              <p>
                ALONGSIDE THIS INITIATIVE, WE HAVE BEEN CLOSELY WATCHING OTHER
                POTENTIAL DECENTRALIZED CLONES OF TWITTER THAT HAVE RECENTLY
                BEEN GAINING TRACTION.
              </p>
              <p>
                PRIOR PLANS WERE MADE TO USE THIS VAMPIRE ATTACK TO DRAW USERS
                FROM TWITTER TO A NEW PLATFORM, BUT AFTER REVIEW OF THE “DIGITAL
                WORLD ORDER REPORT,” A NEW VISION WAS BORN. THE REPORT CONFIRMED
                THAT THE POTENTIAL MARKET CAPITALIZATION OF A DAO CREATED BY A
                TWITTER VAMPIRE ATTACK MAY ALLOW FOR THE ACQUISITION OF TWITTER.
                THE PRIOR MISSION WAS TO JUST MAKE A BETTER TWITTER, NOW IT’S TO
                ACQUIRE IT.
              </p>
              <p>
                THE POTENTIAL TO GENERATE A MEMETIC FLYWHEEL, COMPLETELY TAKING
                OVER THE TWITTER TIMELINE WAS CRAFTED AND SIMULATED. DECENTRELON
                WAS DEVISED.
              </p>
              <p>
                DECENTRELON WAS THEN PLANTED INTO THE PUBLIC EYE TO BEGIN TO
                ALIGN THOUGHT LEADERS AROUND THE IDEA, AND TO HOPEFULLY BE SEEN
                BY ELON MUSK, WHO WOULD BE THE IDEAL CANDIDATE FOR LEADING THE
                DAO. THE MEMETIC FLYWHEEL WOULD BE BEST FACILITATED WITH THE
                INVOLVEMENT OF ELON MUSK IN CLAIMING HIS TOKEN.
              </p>
              <p>
                JUST AS THE STARS MAY ALIGN ON CERTAIN DAYS TO WITNESS AN
                ECLLIPSE, CERTAIN DAYS IN HUMAN HISTORY CAN FURTHER ADD MEMETIC
                FUEL TO THE FIRE OF MOVEMENTS. INDEPENDENCE DAY IS KNOWN
                WORLDWIDE AS A DAY OF FREEDOM FROM OPPRESSIVE POWERS. THE
                UPCOMING JULY 4TH WILL SERVE AS A NEW INDEPENDENCE DAY WITH THE
                LAUNCH OF OPERATION FREEBIRD. THE DAY WILL GO DOWN IN HISTORY AS
                THE SPARK THAT IGNITES THE REVOLUTION OF OUR DIGITAL NATIONS
                (SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS).
              </p>
              <p>
                FOR THE AGENTS WHO QUESTION OUR ALIGNMENT WITH ELON MUSK, AND
                ATTEMPT TO THWART HIS OWN PLAN OF PURCHASE, WE SURELY BELIEVE
                HIS INTENTIONS FOR TWITTER ARE JUST. HOWEVER, WE DO NOT YET SEE
                A CLEAR PATH TO HIM GIVING UP TOTAL CONTROL THE ESTABLISHMENT
                HAS DEDICATED RESOURCES TO DAMAGING HIS PUBLIC IMAGE. FURTHER,
                ELON IS TAKING LARGE INVESTMENTS FROM PRIVATE INVESTORS,
                ENSURING THAT HE IS STILL BEHOLDEN TO SHAREHOLDERS.
              </p>
              <p>
                THE REAL REVOLUTION COMES FROM THE PEOPLE, AS THE MASSES COME
                TOGETHER TO ENTER A NEW AGE OF COOPERATIVE ANTI-ESTABLISHMENT
                FORCE.
              </p>
              <p>
                WE ARE UNDERMANNED FOR THIS OPERATION AND NEED TO RECRUIT
                ADDITIONAL FORCES IMMEDIATELY. THIS LETTER MAY BE SHARED AS A
                BRIEFING, AND ANY NEW AGENTS MAY STAY IN THE WEB4STRESS LOCATION
                IN LOS ANGELES FOR THEIR FIRST FIELD OPERATION IN JUNE.  THE
                WEST WING OF THE RESIDENCES ARE CURRENTLY UNOCCUPIED.

              <p>
                In a world where politics has become a trade,<br />
                Emerges a class with ambitions pre-made.<br />
                They build their castles, secure their power,<br />
                While the common folks in despair, cower.<br />
              </p>
              <p>
                Dynasties form, family ties that bind,<br />
                Voices of the many, left behind.<br />
                Once the rulers start to guard their reign,<br />
                It's the nation that bears the strain.<br />
              </p>
              <p>
                Seats of power meant to echo voices below,<br />
                Swayed by gold, their true colors show.<br />
                A nation divided, majority unheard,<br />
                Craving a change, yearning for the word.<br />
              </p>
              <p>
                In the mission to change, to redefine,<br />
                We place at helm, the truly benign.<br />

                To amplify the people's voice.<br />
              </p>
              <p>
                Operation Free Bird takes flight,<br />
                A beacon, glowing bright in the night.<br />
                A domino effect, echoing change,<br />
                Directly by the people, power range.<br />
              </p>
              <p>
                Our founding fathers' dream, once out of reach,<br />

                Now the speed of light, in our hands today.<br />

              <p>
                No longer need we settle for the less,<br />

                You might fear a chaos, a loud decree,<br />

                Not to vote on every single bill,<br />
                But to let the public will fulfill.<br />
              </p>
              <p>
                A fluid democracy we aspire,<br />
                Burning with fervor, a raging fire.<br />
                The power to delegate, to change and shift,<br />

                Every vote cast from anywhere.<br />
                Our hands hold the power, our voices heard,<br />
                A future where corruption's absurd.<br />
              </p>
              <p>
                Yet the rulers may cling to the old,<br />
                Their power dearer than gold.<br />
                Fear not, for seat by seat we claim,<br />
                In this grand democratic game.<br />
              </p>
              <p>
                The first victory, a domino falls,<br />
                Echoing through the senate halls.<br />
                This future is inevitable, pure and bright,<br />
                Where centralized power fades in the light.<br />

              <h2 class="headh2"><b>PROBLEM:</b></h2>
              <p>
                The problem with representative democracy is that it makes
                politics a job, so we get a political class. It's very easy for
                the political class to become insular. We see this in many
                countries, where a small number of families or dynasties vie for
                power - consider the two Bush presidents, for example, or the
                Clintons.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="image image_tk">
              <img src="part_images/image8.png" alt="image8" />
            </div>
            <div class="content">
              <p>
                Once we have a political class, it becomes concerned with
                safeguarding and extending its own privileges. When this happens
                at the expense of the good of the rest of the nation, it becomes
                a huge problem.
              </p>
              <p>
                While seats at the state and congress level are meant to best
                represent people below them, often times the elected party is
                swayed by financiers rather than representing the public.

              <p>
                Placing a high ranking official in the government, who agrees to
                give away his final say in voting based on votes cast in a
                secure voting application, thus giving people true
                representation in Government.
              </p>
              <p>
                Operation Free The Bird is kickstarting a domino effect, we will
                become a beacon for the replication of this sentiment in order
                to reach a point at which point the US Government will be
                represented directly by the people of America.
              </p>
              <p>
                True representative democracy aka Liquid Democracy is what our
                founding fathers of this nation would have created if the
                technology existed when our nations democratic system was set
                up.
              </p>
              <p>
                The only reason we did not set up true representative democracy
                from the get go is that our communication speed for information
                was that of a horse.
              </p>
              <p>
                Thus, Representatives that represented their state was at that
                time the purest form of democracy possible without causing a
                massive headache in collaboration with thousands of people in a
                room shouting.
              </p>
              <p>
                After over two thousand years, large corporations and an insular
                political class has formed around the power that the government
                represents. Delegates are supposed to represent the majority
                they tend to fall to the power law of financiers. This has led
                our nation to become divided leaving a majority of voices
                unrepresented and unheard.
              </p>
              <p>
                Rather than representatives LOOSELY attempting to represent the
                vote of the public and failing, with todays technology the
                public can now literally be represented.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you are thinking that this means every single person needing
                to vote towards every bill, that would of course be ineffective
                as most people do not have time to research each new proposal
                that is referred to as “Direct Democracy”.
              </p>
              <p>
                Instead, we reach a more fluid democracy by breaking down the
                false barriers we previously placed based on technological
                restrictions, to allow any person to be a representative, and
                for any person to change their vote at any time. That means that
                at any moment, I can give my voting power to any individual in
                the world who I want to represent me, and my vote will be cast
                based on their best judgement.
              </p>
              <p>
                What if the entire political system ran on true democracy that
                everyone could vote on through their phones?
              </p>
              <p>
                Obviously getting political leaders to give up their POWER of
                representation to give true representation to the nation over is
                not going to happen by their will.
              </p>
              <p>
                Instead we will enact this revolution seat by seat of the senate
                and the state. With the first election that completes this
                operation acting as an initial dominos to kickstart this
                inevitable and great future where corruption from centralized
                power is brought to its knees.

                The leading corporation created by intelligent Ai systems will
                create the largest market cap imaginable. The wealth inequality
                of today would pale in comparison with where we are headed. This
                would truly allow a corporation or leader of an organization to
                be an all powerful ruler over the globe. Even if that is not
                their intent, or if they are against it, we worry about the
                notion that absolute power corrupts absolutely.
