            <p><b>MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD</b></p>
            <p><b>SUBJECT: OPERATION DECENTRELON UPDATE</b></p>
            <p>A call to arms.</p>
            <p>
              As many of you are aware, there has been plenty of recent discussions about the oppressive
              nature of twitter as pushed forward by elon musk.
            </p>
            <p>
              Earlier this year, a group of operatives were tasked with creating a beta-test for a
              tweet-to-claim function, prepping for a vampire attack on twitter.
            </p>
            <p>
              Alongside this initiative, we have been closely watching other potential decentralized
              clones of twitter that have recently been gaining traction.
            </p>
            <p>
              Prior plans were made to use this vampire attack to draw users from twitter to a new
              platform, but after review of the “digital world order report,” a new vision was born. The
              report confirmed that the potential market capitalization of a dao created by a twitter
              vampire attack may allow for the acquisition of twitter. The prior mission was to just make
              a better twitter, now it’s to acquire it.
            </p>
            <p>The potential to generate a memetic flywheel, completely taking over the twitter timeline was
              crafted and simulated. Decentrelon was devised.
            </p>
            <p>
              Decentrelon was then planted into the public eye to begin to align thought leaders around
              the idea, and to hopefully be seen by elon musk, who would be the ideal candidate for
              leading the dao. The memetic flywheel would be best facilitated with the involvement of elon
              musk in claiming his token.
            </p>
            <p>
              Just as the stars may align on certain days to witness an ecllipse, certain days in human
              history can further add memetic fuel to the fire of movements. Independence day is known
              worldwide as a day of freedom from oppressive powers. The upcoming july 4th will serve as a
              new independence day with the launch of operation freebird. The day will go down in history
              as the spark that ignites the revolution of our digital nations (social media platforms).
            </p>
            <p>
              For the agents who question our alignment with elon musk, and attempt to thwart his own plan
              of purchase, we surely believe his intentions for twitter are just. However, we do not yet
              see a clear path to him giving up total control the establishment has dedicated resources to
              damaging his public image. Further, elon is taking large investments from private investors,
              ensuring that he is still beholden to shareholders.
            </p>
            <p>
              The real revolution comes from the people, as the masses come together to enter a new age of
              cooperative anti-establishment force.
            </p>
            <p>
              We are undermanned for this operation and need to recruit additional forces *immediately*.
              This letter may be shared as a briefing, and any new agents may stay in the web4stress
              location in los angeles for their first field operation in june.  The west wing of the
              residences are currently unoccupied.

            <p>

              A nation divided, majority unheard,<br />
              Craving a change, yearning for the word.<br />

            <h2 class="headh2"><b>PROBLEM:</b></h2>
            <p>
              The problem with representative democracy is that it makes
              politics a job, so we get a political class. It's very easy
              for the political class to become insular. We see this in many
              countries, where a small number of families or dynasties vie
              for power - consider the two Bush presidents, for example, or
              the Clintons.

          <div class="content">
            <p>
              Once we have a political class, it becomes concerned with
              safeguarding and extending its own privileges. When this
              happens at the expense of the good of the rest of the nation,
              it becomes a huge problem.
            </p>
            <p>
              While seats at the state and congress level are meant to best
              represent people below them, often times the elected party is
              swayed by financiers rather than representing the public.

            <p>
              Placing a high ranking official in the government, who agrees
              to give away his final say in voting based on votes cast in a
              secure voting application, thus giving people true
              representation in Government.
            </p>
            <p>
              Operation Free The Bird is kickstarting a domino effect, we
              will become a beacon for the replication of this sentiment in
              order to reach a point at which point the US Government will
              be represented directly by the people of America.
            </p>
            <p>
              True representative democracy aka Liquid Democracy is what our
              founding fathers of this nation would have created if the
              technology existed when our nations democratic system was set
              up.
            </p>
            <p>
              The only reason we did not set up true representative
              democracy from the get go is that our communication speed for
              information was that of a horse.
            </p>
            <p>
              Thus, Representatives that represented their state was at that
              time the purest form of democracy possible without causing a
              massive headache in collaboration with thousands of people in
              a room shouting.
            </p>
            <p>
              After over two thousand years, large corporations and an
              insular political class has formed around the power that the
              government represents. Delegates are supposed to represent the
              majority they tend to fall to the power law of financiers.
              This has led our nation to become divided leaving a majority
              of voices unrepresented and unheard.
            </p>
            <p>
              Rather than representatives LOOSELY attempting to represent
              the vote of the public and failing, with todays technology the
              public can now literally be represented.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you are thinking that this means every single person
              needing to vote towards every bill, that would of course be
              ineffective as most people do not have time to research each
              new proposal that is referred to as “Direct Democracy”.
            </p>
            <p>
              Instead, we reach a more fluid democracy by breaking down the
              false barriers we previously placed based on technological
              restrictions, to allow any person to be a representative, and
              for any person to change their vote at any time. That means
              that at any moment, I can give my voting power to any
              individual in the world who I want to represent me, and my
              vote will be cast based on their best judgement.
            </p>
            <p>
              What if the entire political system ran on true democracy that
              everyone could vote on through their phones?
            </p>
            <p>
              Obviously getting political leaders to give up their POWER of
              representation to give true representation to the nation over
              is not going to happen by their will.
            </p>
            <p>
              Instead we will enact this revolution seat by seat of the
              senate and the state. With the first election that completes
              this operation acting as an initial dominos to kickstart this
              inevitable and great future where corruption from centralized
              power is brought to its knees.

            <p>
              The leading corporation created by intelligent Ai systems will
              create the largest market cap imaginable. The wealth
              inequality of today would pale in comparison with where we are
              headed. This would truly allow a corporation or leader of an
              organization to be an all powerful ruler over the globe. Even
              if that is not their intent, or if they are against it, we
              worry about the notion that absolute power corrupts
              absolutely.
