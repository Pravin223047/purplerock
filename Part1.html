                “I saw this video for the first time about 3 years ago, and it
                REALLY struck a chord. From the moment I set foot in school at
                the ripe old age of 5 or 6 I’ve known that our current system of
                education is seriously broken. My wife, and virtually everyone
                else I know, agrees wholeheartedly. In fact, my wife and I are
                so sure that traditional, formal education is broken that we’ve
                decided to NEVER allow our son to set foot in public school. Or
                private school. Or any school at all, at least not one that’s
                structured around such a hideously archaic system.
              </p>
              <p>
                You see, we’re absolutely confident that we can do an infinitely
                better job of teaching our son than anyone else ever could. And
                we believe we can do it without taking from him the very essence
                of who he is. The greatest things that we are born with are
                imagination, creativity, and a sense of wonder, hope and
                possibility. We enter this world absolutely certain that
                anything is possible, with a flexible, sponge-like mind. But bit
                by bit, year after year, every one of those traits that make us
                exceptional is stamped and beaten and ground out of us until
                what’s left is just…average. The system likes conformity, not
                outliers.
              </p>
              <p>
                Why the hell do we allow this to happen? And why the hell to we
                allow others to do this to our children? 50 years, 100 years,
                1,000 years down the road, nobody will remember the sheep, the
                cogs in the machine, the factory workers and laborers…the
                average. Why should they?
              </p>
              <p>
                We remember Plato and Einstein, Galileo and Michelangelo,
                Columbus and Alexander the Great…we remember the great, the
                visionaries, the heretics, the geniuses…not the mediocre. We
                remember, and revere, the exceptional. But each and every one of
                us, at birth, is exceptional. We’re the most intelligent,
                adaptable creatures on the planet. We have the ability to become
                absolutely anything that we set our minds to becoming. So why,
                why don’t we teach and train and encourage our children to not
                only keep the gifts that they come into the world with, but to
                actually reach for the stars? Why don’t we teach them that
                anything is possible??

                I personally HATED school, more than words can ever effectively
                express. Do you know why? I hated school because I hated being
                told that things could only be done a certain way, that there
                was one acceptable path/solution/action. I have a crystal clear
                recollection of figuring out an alternate way to solve a math
                problem, and having my teacher tell me “that’s not the right way
                to solve the problem.” Who gives a flying crap if it isn’t the
                “right” way? I solved the bloody problem, didn’t I? It worked
                for other similar problems, so it was a valid path to the
                solution, yes? Then why wasn’t it acceptable? Because it wasn’t
                the “right” way.
              </p>
              <p>
                The only part of life that is remotely linear is our lifespan,
                birth to death. Everything else goes every which way. Up, down,
                left, right, slant-ways, in ways, out ways…why, even up and out!
                Willy Wonka was one smart cookie I have always had a gift for
                taking complex things and finding simple solutions. I’m creative
                and imaginative by nature, and I believe the reason I had such a
                terrible time at school was because it kept trying to beat those
                things out of me. And so I just kept fighting, refusing to allow
                a flawed system to take from me the things that made me…me. But
                not everyone can persevere like that…most people give in, go
                with the flow, and lose an integral part of who they are along
                the way. I don’t say this to make me look better, or special,
                but to point out that way, WAY too many kids are being changed
                by school, and not for the better.

                Beyond that Holy Vible is an app which represents a growing
                community of people who are on that path of seeking their higher
                selves. Of seeing the potential of themselves, and humanity, to
                engage with beauty, courage, honor, and virtue. That can help
                lead us all, to a new golden age.

                Traditional, formal education is NOT the path to a better
                future. An alternative, modern, technological solution is
                needed, and I am SO grateful that my son is going to grow up in
                a world with options like

                free, online, to virtually anyone, virtually anywhere, than is
                housed in all the schools and universities on the planet. Hell,
                we now create more data every 2 days than we did cumulatively

                The downfall of value in modern day institutions is blatantly
                obvious to any person who spends 4 years of their life with
                effort towards creating value themselves. Instead of being
                taught to earn with your mind, you are taught to become a
                follower and memorizer. You never play with creating value in
                the real world, how is that in any way shape or form going to
                make you an expert at it? Outside of Medical, Law and Trade
                schools, this system is ready for upgraded alternatives.
              </p>
              <p>
                Given every schools purpose is to teach you how to create value
                in the world, if the school needs to charge you to get in to
                teach you to create value, it is not a good enough institution
                to turn your work into value. If they charge you upfront, but
                not offer you rewards to earn back your money from successful
                course work, they are not a school that is serious about
                teaching you how to create value.
              </p>
              <p>
                As the world progresses faster and faster changing the job
                market, our universities course materials continue to decline in
                value. On the other hand, the capability to turn a unique talent
                into life changing income has never been easier and the building
                blocks of founding a startup have never been more streamlined
                and prepackaged.
              </p>
              <p>
                The entire goal of a university is to teach a student how to
                create value in the real world, but the curriculums today are
                outdated, and lack real world projects. Successful institutions
                should see a percent of their class make millions of dollars in
                their first few semesters. Beyond that, schools separate course
                work from the real world. They lack a focus on impact and value
                creation and separate the two making it impossible for students
                to truly test their capability to create value. Tuition to go to
                the school is proof of this failure in making the four years of
                a students time and effort into enough value to sustain the
                institution. Instead, institutions should be so good at teaching
                their students to create value that they pay the students to go
                to school.

                We see Startup College as the best investment model for direct
                value creation. Our college completely de-risks the path of
                entrepreneurship while retaining the potential of the
                exponential path. We formed our course material baed on 1st
                principles thinking around the future of company building,
                storytelling and de-risking the choice to become a founder.

                  The best way we can build many ventures, and increase the

                From a
                <a href="https://fs.blog/first-principles/">first principles</a>
                perspective every company structure is a vision for the future
                created by a human or humans that utilizes capital or future
                potential of capital to give employees comfort/incentive to give
                their time towards providing value to the idea in different
                ways. Founders taking the risk of becoming a founder has become
                overvalued because a lack of supply. A Founders College not only
                taps into the positive framework for parents of their child
                attending a post-highschool training system, but allows the
                generation of the most valuable form of labor in business. We
                need more stories being told in the world of young people
                innovating, ones that we can support and follow rather than some
                tragedy we can do nothing about.
              </p>
              <p>
                In this day an age, being a storyteller on the internet is not
                just a job for companies where pay is rapidly increasing, but an
                entire emerging economy structure. The power of storytelling is
                one thing, the next is that being a real human is far from being
                replaceable as a job.
              </p>
              <p>
                With 50% of human attention now on the digital over physical,
                and the main point of that use being social media, it’d be hard
                not to create a massive industry from the people who have
                learned to master the social platforms and have their content
                seen by millions.
              </p>
              <p>
                Instead of watching Disney Channel, kids are watching Tiktok.
                The top creators on these platforms have created generational
                wealth in just a couple years.
              </p>
              <p>
                These Tiktok stars own their own future rather than being agents
                of Disney. They have direct ways to interact with their
                audience, and lead a future where anything they do now has more
                support, a bigger network, and people who are following their
                story.
              </p>
              <p>
                The positive effects are truly priceless. I mean are we not
                impressed when two football teams sell out a stadium? With
                hundreds of staff, players, coaches, team, weeks of practice,
                and training camps the teams would get 50k people in that
                stadium. Now with the power of the internet people of all ages,
                of any background, can get a million plays, that’s 20 fully
                packed football stadiums, with eyes not on an entire field of
                players, just you. It’s obvious when stated this why how
                impactful this can be.
              </p>
              <p>
                Colleges are getting outdated. People dedicating their time to
                learn the craft of content are joining an emerging creator
                economy. Meanwhile schools with increasing tuition train you for
                jobs which are being automated. Being a human is the last thing
                any artificial intelligence could do, literally. Talk about job
                security.

                Lastly, as we move towards a post scarcity society and the
                potential for existential dread increases in the face of rapidly
                changing culture and prior institutions/traditions, people will
                heighten their search for a coherent philosophy that not only
                resonates with them but provides pathways for community and
                action based on these principles.
