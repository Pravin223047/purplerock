              <p>Engagement algorithms are extremely toxic.</p>
              <p>
                Our most popular platforms today are centralized systems of
                control that exploit us rather than empower us. Users and
                creators are disconnected from the value they create, and hold
                no ownership from their contributions to the platform. Instead,
                they and all users are treated as income streams where user data
                is collected, hidden from the users, and sold to further mine
                profits.
              </p>
              <p>
                Outside of the incentive system being broken, we are letting
                ENGAGEMENT algorithms run the entire recommendation feed of
                every major social platform today massively effecting the moods
                and critical thinking skills of our peers and children. From a
                consumer standpoint, the algorithm that the user is force-fed
                content from is unable to be changed, which develops a toxic
                relationship between the platform and the user.
              </p>
              <p>
                As we as a society continue to make progress in identifying
                physical and mental health risks, this engagement algorithm is
                finally shifting in the public eye for the evil that it is.
                While these algorithms may not get any less toxic and addicting,
                we can hope for new cultural boundaries to be set that will push
                people to live healthier lifestyles.
              </p>
              <p>
                Just like with cigarettes the addictive nature was weaponized by
                corporations who saw the capability to hook users, before our
                culture caught up to vilify cigarettes for what they actually
                did. Luckily we largely overcame that battle as a culture and
                while the cigarette itself did not get any less addicting, we
                simply upgraded our cultural boundaries which matured to
                avoidance of these unhealthy dopamine sticks.
              </p>
              <p>Now, we face dopamine flicks.</p>
              <p>
                While returning to breathing air was the simple alternative for
                cigarettes, getting people to stop using these toxic platforms
                requires a healthy replacement of social, educational, and
                entertainment platform that is captivating, but empowering.
              </p>
              <p>
                We wholeheartedly believe that Social Media and content
                recommendation systems can empower individuals rather than
                extract from them and we are making a bet on culture moving
                forward to understand choosing algorithms like a picking to hang
                with a toxic or healthy friend. Especially as we as a society
                help the understanding that our peers and children are being
                given information by a super toxic, and negative persona because
                in reality that's exactly what the algorithm is designed to do.
                Engagement algorithms maximize your engagement at all costs, not
                factoring in your mental health.
              </p>
              <p>
                Whether it’s a friend or an algorithm, both are external filters
                for new information and experiences. To make the toxic trait
                more clear let’s personify the engagement algorithm for your
                friend Karen. Karen does not care about you or your well being,
                in fact the one thing Karen cares about is getting as much
                attention of yours as possible. Karen has zero regard for your
                mental health. In fact, Karen has no limit on what she wants
                from you. Her end goal is having you not move from your bed, or
                the couch, and if you want to talk to your friends, she only
                wants it to go through her.
              </p>
              <p>
                TikTok was the top performing social platform in 2021 and is
                winning this 2022. By allowing user generated videos in the
                vertical format and providing an infinite feed of content, it
                took the social world by storm. Kids and Adults have become so
                addicted to it that it has taken over a majority of the
                attention sphere and its creator ByteDance is now worth over
                $470 Billion. But many of their users distrust the platform as
                it is a known centralized spyware platform with all data being
                fed to the Chinese Government. Socialverse aims to fix these
                problems through transparency and progressive decentralization,
                which will increasing allow user governance over the platform.

                Creating Videos On Certain Subjects Requires A Bunch Of Effort.
                Alot of the best information is generated by people who have
                specialized in writing skills. This format limits distribution
                of high quality information to the masses.
              </p>
              <p>
                More importantly, the ability to take over the attention economy
                and create a centralized mass media company is a potential risk
                if in the hands of purely capitalistic minds. It will be less
                profitable, but better for humanity for this capability to build
                a massive media company to be used to empower and educate than
                to extract.

                will exist from auto-generated content which is the distribution
                of it. Doing so will allow us to have every single piece gain
                global influence, with automatic translations and voiceovers in
                new languages, and posting to separate accounts on major

                For the same price as a Louie Vitton bag, a family could have a
                roof over their heads for the rest of their life. If a penny
                saved is a penny earned, then a Louie Bag is a home burned.
                Right now there is no alternative bag that also gives the buyer
                status, while representing and completing this altruistic
                mission. The greater goal here is to enter the entertainment /
                arts market and influence the main thing we wear which
                collectively defines status around a certain metric. Currently
                that is purely $$$, we think changing it to altruism will
                massively reshape culture in a positive way.

                We live in a world that rests on an assumption that we can
                fathom what is possible and what is not. Yet history has shown
                us that the impossible often becomes possible, and that the
                dreams that seem out of our reach become very real. Everything
                on this earth, every one of humanity’s achievements is simply a
                manifestation of how high we have previously aimed.

                Religion and Philosophy have long sense been our deepest set
                frameworks, marking our vision for the future and holding us to
                a certain standard of operating in the world. Many of the most
                famous ones tell the same core truths with wildly different
                names and stories.
              </p>
              <p>
                In that sense religions are packaging the idea of faith, hope,
                and eternal life in different ways often adding a rulebook to
                them. Nowadays these dogmas of the past are losing their ability
                to motivate.

                We seek to build arks of philosophy/religion/vibes that act as
                doorways to faith for a better future. In an understanding of
                vibes, ideas, philosophies, and relationships as the eternally
                beneficial portions of life we focus on them as the core.

                <b
                  >It’s impossible to take an action without the motivation to do
                  so</b
                >the larger the motivation the more action that will be taken.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you can
                <b
                  >change the worlds motivations you change the output of man,
                  changing the future timeline we exist in.</b
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                There is no GREATER impact, no greater altruist movement, then
                switching more nodes of the human race into a path of faith,
                abundance, and motivation to make positive change in THEIR life,
                and thus others.
              </p>
              <p>
                Not only that but with the falling rates of belief in previous
                faith frameworks are primed for a new global unifying
                philosophy.
              </p>
              <p>
                In order to make this change and have the HIGHEST POSSIBLE
                EFFECT POSSIBLE I believe we need to get AS MANY people possible
                to agree with this too (I mean that’s no surprise).
              </p>
              <p>
                After all, your identity creates your perception which creates
                your thoughts which creates your actions. If we can help point
                people to a brighter north star, we have a much higher chance of
                getting there.
              </p>
              <p>
                preading this north star is the most effective thing one can do
                in terms of bringing to light its achievement. The core idea of
                the philosophies / religions below very much the same. The core
                goal for all of them is to provide people a new COMMUNITY to
                identify with that has this goal of an increase in meaning,
                perspective, thinking of others, etc.
              </p>

                  ideas, </b
                >from which we will be looking to create movements from. We will
                try each one out on a launchpad, with media, and social
                accounts, recruiting mechanisms, and having various thought
                leaders help run them, and we will see which STICK in society
                and spread. In business this is called finding product-market
                fit.
