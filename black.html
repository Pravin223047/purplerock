            <p>
              In today's interconnected world, the internet has played a
              significant role in fostering a global community where ideas and
              dreams can flourish. This unprecedented level of connectivity has
              led to a collective realization that we are living in a truly
              pivotal time.

            <p>
              <b>1.</b> We recognize that each action, in every moment answers
              the individual question of “Who Am I?”.
              <br />
              <b>2.</b> We recognize that every person tells themselves a story
              about who they are and what they are meant to become, changing
              what actions they take on a daily basis.
              <br />
              <b>3.</b> We look at these new beginnings as the perfect
              opportunity to commit to helping be a positive force for the
              creation of this better future.
              <br />
              <b>4.</b> We are driven to act towards effective positive impact
              based on a realization that every action defines the story of our
              soul.
              <br />
              <b>5.</b> We recognize that we are all man among gods (children)
              in the sense that everyone will become cared for by a god we birth
              from our collective superorganism.
              <br />
              <b>6.</b> We believe we are here in our infancy to learn to find,
              retain, and act on this awareness of the collective’s inherent
              importance in our lives.
              <br />
              <b>7.</b> We question authority, and seek collective ownership.

            <h2 class="heading">Our Mission</h2>
            <p>
              We are focused on offering the world a positive public narrative
              to offer a story that attempts to make every person feel empowered
              and valued in helping make things go right. As artificial
              intelligence is accelerating, the purpose of IQ diminishing, as
              the need for EQ raises. Its imperative more of humanity recognizes
              that we are in this together. Through this mindset, the best
              stories and the dreams of non-profits can finally become realized
              supported by the abundance our techno-capital machine creates.
              <br />
              As we enter an age of great surplus, it becomes more important to
              focus not just on using power for the sake of gain, but with a
              focus the empowerment of individuals and the whole. This is the
              age of recalibration, where spiritual machines which align our
              highest interests will be most important in bringing to market. As
              a humanity, we’ve lost the control switch on civilization and need
              movements which will help us recalibrate, and align around truth,
              and systemic, systematic plans.

            <h2 class="heading">Looking The Problem We Face, In The Face</h2>
            <p>
              Humanity can be considered its own organism or super-intelligence.
              We might look at the internet as the nervous system of our
              collective body with social media being the emergent method that
              information is spread. A majority of all global communication is
              fed through this nervous system, and the signals are sorted
              towards what provokes the most extraction of value from each one
              of our individual cells. While there are benefits from the
              democratization of our voice from the broadcast era, the
              underlying algorithms which sort the things we share is
              misaligned. Engagement algorithms will not naturally foster this
              discourse as it is inherently aligned at

              People want to have the best opinion, but when the best opinions

              today’s paradigm of ai algorithms causes hyper-charged tribalism.
              <br />
              Hypercharged tribalism happens when a concentrated tribal divide
              reaches such intensity that it resembles a religious war,
              subsuming the entire society and the people within it.
              Hypercharged tribalism turns thinking, feeling human beings into
              loyal colony ants, overriding their intellect, their humanity,
              even their love of family and friends. It’s a form of group
              madness—a contagion that spreads like an epidemic, awakening the
              ancient survival instincts in millions of minds all at once, as
              huge groups of people slip into golem mode in lockstep.
              <br />
              The next hyper-charged tribalism that will occur on the internet
              will be on the topic of Ai as it scales the potential of human
              will exponentially.
              <br />
              Thus, the worry about the idea of Ai misalignment will GROW
              alongside its power to divide us.
              <br />
              The people who consume their truth by popularity of these
              “in-groups” rather than creating it from first principles, will
              get sold false claims by false gods, served by the failed
              landscape of collective sense-making through social platforms.
              <br />
              Yet these extreme viewpoints are not without some benefit. They
              will each hold a key showing off the actual truth of the middle
              ground.
              <br />
              Understanding this tendency allows one to view the sides that form
              with a sense of pity, and we can resonate with both ends of the
              spectrum, to help us see what is actually right.
              <br />
              It is likely one side will fear the exponential growth, pushing
              out a message like “Pause”, “Stop”, and “Control”, they will gain
              support by big companies, state power, and politicians who benefit
              from this regulatory capture. The other side will praise
              exponential growth… with a message of “optimism”, “Accelerate”,
              “WAGMI”, and other positive lingo and this will benefit, founders,
              investors and people needing copium.

            <h2 class="heading">The Middle Way</h2>
            <p>
              <b>1.</b> We too often view hyper-charged tribalism as a human
              problem, as if it was not a coordination of information problem.
              As if our human hearts wanted climate change to be a thing. Too
              many are not realizing we have ape-like minds and paleo-lithic
              institutions who are ultimately being controlled by the flow of
              information through super computer machines who view your brain as
              a coal mine. Mass extraction, leaving it a dead pit always
              returning to get mined more, is its supreme goal. To fix it we
              must simply focus on fixing the underlying problem.
              <br />
              <b>2.</b> Ai alignment is the worlds biggest problem, people are
              pushed and divided towards extremist positions rather than focused
              on higher accuracy truth. This truth will not be spread through
              the algorithm, for someone who learns it, and leaves the platform
              will leave a negative mark on the memetic potential of this idea.
              Instead hysterical sci-fi fantasies about the obliteration of our
              world will cause people to focus on trying to find some golden key
              to align this future super power, rather than seeing fixing
              present misalignment as the golden ticket for an empowered,
              unified, super organism.
              <br />
              <b>3.</b> We are enmeshed in psychological warfare beyond any
              individual’s ability to understand. Hundreds of thousands of
              algorithms vying and competing, for the right to own our
              attention. The core of our soul is being siphoned.
              <br />
              <b>4.</b> Our society is plagued with strong cocktails of
              artificial sources of dopamine that distract and attack critical
              thinking pushing your state towards the bottom of your brain stem.

              machine.

              by building communities of empowerment who coalesce around
              strength, truth, and positive virtues. To build an application

              <br />
              <b>10.</b> The people so focused on Ai in the world are either
              going to want to boundlessly accelerate, solving the uncomfortable
              part of their mind which requires heightened responsibility and
              action from them with believing the hyper-charged tribalism.
              <br />
              <b>11.</b> Or the beauty of their hearts trying to help but led
              towards no true mission, will lead them to want to completely stop
              Ai once and for all, and rather than actually solving the
              misaligned Ai which brought us here in the first place, they will
              virtue signal at the top political rung to stop the field
              completely, or focus on pie in the sky theoretical fixes in order
              to always require more funding, without a measure for real world
              progress.
              <br />
              <b>12.</b> Do not fall into these camps, they are internet traps.
              They WILL be popular online sub-culture, but they will inevitably
              be overtaken by growth mindset people. A memetic open-source
              philosophy of evolving, which builds tools to align towards higher
              truth seems to be the tribe that will win this age of new
              enlightenment. The game has shifted, and closed-source is no
              longer attainable. There will be no more prophets, only non-profit
              leaders who are truly <b>BY THE PEOPLE</b>, and
              <b>FOR THE PEOPLE</b>.

            <h2 class="heading">The Need For Leadership</h2>
            <p>
              <b>1.</b> In the present times, many individuals are apprehensive
              about the future due to a lack of direction to channel their
              positive energy and without a global agenda that promotes unity
              and empowers people, divisive actions tend to prevail. It is
              crucial, now more than ever, to establish a unifying global agenda
              supported by individuals and organizations, which can ignite
              positive change and create a bright future for all.
              <br />
              <b>2.</b> Our organization is bound by a collective understanding
              that as we move towards a post-scarcity world, the ability to
              create a better world for others is the only scarce resource that
              will be worthy of accumulating. Less measurable than wealth, the
              switch to Karmic Capitalism / Enlightened Capitalism will
              accelerate the positive facing standpoint of humanity at large
              entering us into a true golden age. This revolution, of a cultural
              restructuring towards altruism above money hoarding, is inevitable
              as people realize the only eternal currency being the status of
              helping create that bright future.
              <br />
              <b>3.</b> As the world begins to understand this we enter a state
              of realizing our individual capability to focus on actualizing on
              our potential. This comes from the natural law that after the
              world enters a state of perfection, you either find fulfillment or
              regret in your works. With no more good deeds left to do, eternal
              heaven and eternal hell manifest not as places outside of your own
              mind. Judgement day is a time we will all face when we have to
              accept ourselves for who we were when we knew who we could become.
              <br />
              <b>4.</b> Grouped by this positive virus of information which lies
              embedded into the laws of the universe, we are creating a new
              nation. United not on the physical plane, but in the cloud. This
              is our manifesto as a cyber-army fighting not other people, but
              the mistreatment and extraction of people worldwide.

              <b>5.</b> Our line of work is a focus on education and empowerment
              to the highest degree. We will support ourselves and our continued
              impact by providing free resources and structures to BUILD
              founders and entrepreneurs. This line of work is not only the most
              positive in resource feedback loops but harnesses the power of
              strong ecosystem effects.
              <br />
              <b>6.</b> Rather than any working gears of the machine getting
              surplus, all extra profit gets geared back into the machine. Our
              organization operates in alignment with Buddhist decree. The
              payout to the operators is true wealth of impacting the world and
              a position in the future of the universe at large as one of the
              better angels of our nature. This is missionary work, fueled by an
              understanding of the true eternal currency of the universe.
