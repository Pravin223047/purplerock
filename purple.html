            <h2 class="heading">Why Purple?</h2>
            <p>
              As you may already know the color purple is the only color which
              exists in our perception, and not as a single wavelength of light.
              <br />
              The rainbow of visible light from red to violet floods our
              surroundings, but there is no such thing as purple light.
              <br />

        <div class="description">
          <div class="about_content">
            <h2 class="heading">How does this work?</h2>
            <p>
              We perceive color thanks to three different types of color
              receptor cells, or cones, in our eyes. Each type of cone is
              sensitive to a range of colors, but one is most excited by red
              light, one by green and one blue.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="description">
          <div class="about_content imgbox">
            <h2 class="heading head-1">So how do do see purple?</h2>
            <p>
              <b>1.</b> What we perceive as color is of course the response of
              our visual system to different frequencies of light created by the
              physical response of the cones sending electrical signals to the
              brain.
              <br />
              <b>2.</b> Photons vibrating 450 trillion times a second bump into
              a receptor in our eye and we experience red – a miracle in its own
              right. Others vibrating around 575 trillion times a second arrive
              and we experience green. Others vibrating at a frequency somewhere
              between those two arrive and we experience yellow. These “yellow”
              photons excite both the red and green cones, but we experience
              this as yellow. So imagine instead that red and green light enter
              our eyes simultaneously. Just as with yellow light both our red
              and green cones get excited. So what’s the difference?
              <br />
              <b>3.</b> Well, in terms of our experience, there is none. We do
              in fact “see” yellow. We might casually say that if you mix red
              and green light you “get” yellow, but that’s not strictly true.
              What you get is excited red and green cones and you perceive that
              as yellow.
              <br />
              <b>4.</b> Okay, so what about purple? Well, if you mix red and
              blue light you excite red and blue cones and you experience
              purple. There’s no doubting that. But unlike yellow, if you look
              for light whose frequency is half way between red and blue to do
              the same job you are slap bang in the middle of the greens, and
              not surprisingly what you see is green, not purple at all.
            </p>

        <div class="description">
          <div class="about_content imgbox">
            <p>
              <b>5.</b> So the only way we can experience purple is by seeing
              red and blue simultaneously. **There is no such thing as purple
              light.** No single frequency of electromagnetic radiation can give
              you that purple feeling.
              <br />
              <b>6.</b> The experience of purple is an anomaly of the way we see
              color and as such I would suggest that it is the most intimate and
              personal of colors, created purely in the depths of our perceptual
              system. This is not true of any other color but regal, sensual
              purple.
              <br />
              <b>7.</b> Purple represents the necessity of two sides coming
              together to form an experience that can only be perceived from
              both parts.
              <br />
              <b>8.</b> Purple stands as a testament to the necessity of dual
              components coming together to form an experience perceived from
              both parts.
